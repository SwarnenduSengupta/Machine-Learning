##Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har  (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

##Project objectives

Inserting the libraries needed for this type of analysis.
```{r}
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rpart)
library(rattle)
set.seed(1234)
```

Reading the files :-
```{r}
testing=read.csv("/home/swarnendu/Data_Science/practical-machine-learning-master/pml-testing.csv",na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
training=read.csv("/home/swarnendu/Data_Science/practical-machine-learning-master/pml-training.csv",na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
```
Here, I have already installed the files and then I run the program.

Now splitting the data set into a ratio of 60% - 40% for analysis purpose.
```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
myTraining <- training[inTrain, ]; myTesting <- training[-inTrain, ]
dim(myTraining); dim(myTesting)
```
We have also split the data set into the teating and training datasets.   

##Cleaning the data

The following transformations were used to clean the data:

Transformation 1: Cleaning NearZeroVariance Variables. Run this code to view possible NZV Variables:  
```{r}
myDataNZV <- nearZeroVar(myTraining, saveMetrics=TRUE)
myNZVvars <- names(myTraining) %in% c("new_window", "kurtosis_roll_belt", "kurtosis_picth_belt",
                                      "kurtosis_yaw_belt", "skewness_roll_belt", "skewness_roll_belt.1", "skewness_yaw_belt",
                                      "max_yaw_belt", "min_yaw_belt", "amplitude_yaw_belt", "avg_roll_arm", "stddev_roll_arm",
                                      "var_roll_arm", "avg_pitch_arm", "stddev_pitch_arm", "var_pitch_arm", "avg_yaw_arm",
                                      "stddev_yaw_arm", "var_yaw_arm", "kurtosis_roll_arm", "kurtosis_picth_arm",
                                      "kurtosis_yaw_arm", "skewness_roll_arm", "skewness_pitch_arm", "skewness_yaw_arm",
                                      "max_roll_arm", "min_roll_arm", "min_pitch_arm", "amplitude_roll_arm", "amplitude_pitch_arm",
                                      "kurtosis_roll_dumbbell", "kurtosis_picth_dumbbell", "kurtosis_yaw_dumbbell", "skewness_roll_dumbbell",
                                      "skewness_pitch_dumbbell", "skewness_yaw_dumbbell", "max_yaw_dumbbell", "min_yaw_dumbbell",
                                      "amplitude_yaw_dumbbell", "kurtosis_roll_forearm", "kurtosis_picth_forearm", "kurtosis_yaw_forearm",
                                      "skewness_roll_forearm", "skewness_pitch_forearm", "skewness_yaw_forearm", "max_roll_forearm",
                                      "max_yaw_forearm", "min_roll_forearm", "min_yaw_forearm", "amplitude_roll_forearm",
                                      "amplitude_yaw_forearm", "avg_roll_forearm", "stddev_roll_forearm", "var_roll_forearm",
                                      "avg_pitch_forearm", "stddev_pitch_forearm", "var_pitch_forearm", "avg_yaw_forearm",
                                      "stddev_yaw_forearm", "var_yaw_forearm")
myTraining <- myTraining[!myNZVvars]
```
Transformation 2: Killing first column of Dataset - ID Removing first ID variable so that it does not interfer with ML Algorithms:  
```{r}
myTraining <- myTraining[c(-1)]
```
Transformation 3 : Leaving out those with more than 60% NAs.  
```{r}
trainingV3 <- myTraining #creating another subset to iterate in loop
for(i in 1:length(myTraining)) { #for every column in the training dataset
  if( sum( is.na( myTraining[, i] ) ) /nrow(myTraining) >= .6 ) { #if n?? NAs > 60% of total observations
    for(j in 1:length(trainingV3)) {
      if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(trainingV3)[j]) ) ==1)  { #if the columns are the same:
        trainingV3 <- trainingV3[ , -j] #Remove that column
      }   
    } 
  }
}
#To check the new N?? of observations
dim(trainingV3)
myTraining <- trainingV3
rm(trainingV3)
```

Now repeating the same for the rest of the datasets.
```{r}
clean1 <- colnames(myTraining)
clean2 <- colnames(myTraining[, -58]) #already with classe column removed
myTesting <- myTesting[clean1]
testing <- testing[clean2]
#To check the new N?? of observations
dim(myTesting)

#To check the new N?? of observations
dim(testing)
```
In order to ensure proper functioning of Decision Trees and especially RandomForest Algorithm with the Test data set (data set provided), we need to coerce the data into the same type.
```{r}
for (i in 1:length(testing) ) {
  for(j in 1:length(myTraining)) {
    if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(testing)[j]) ) ==1)  {
      class(testing[j]) <- class(myTraining[i])
    }      
  }      
}
#And to make sure Coertion really worked, simple smart ass technique:
testing <- rbind(myTraining[2, -58] , testing) #note row 2 does not mean anything, this will be removed right.. now:
testing <- testing[-1,]
```
#Using ML algorithms: Decision Trees
```{r}
#decision trees
modFitA1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=myTraining, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(modFitA1)
```
#prediction
```{r}
predictionsA1 <- predict(modFitA1, myTesting, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(predictionsA1, myTesting$classe)
```
#Using ML algorithms: Random forest
```{r}
#Random forest
modFitB1 <- randomForest(classe ~. , data=myTraining)
```
#predicting in-sample error
```{r}
predictionsB1 <- predict(modFitB1, myTesting, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(predictionsB1, myTesting$classe)
```
##Generating files for the end writeup
```{r}
predictionB2<-predict(modFitB1, testing, type="class")
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}

pml_write_files(predictionB2)
```
